  Recently, I've created the
    <a href="https://github.com/Qonfused/YOINK">
      <img
        align="top"
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qonfused/YOINK/main/docs/assets/logo.png"

      <strong>YOINK<strong>
    </a>
  framework to create smarter and cheaper <strong>language models</strong> with
  the help of some clever <strong>instruction-tuning</strong> and
  <strong>transfer-learning</strong> tricks. This builds upon the work of
  <strong>WarpSpeed</strong> to enable training large
  <strong>machine-learning<strong> models on all shapes and sizes of hardware,
  for everyone.

  In my free time, I work on a <strong>Hackintosh</strong> project for the
    <a href="https://github.com/Qonfused/ASUS-ZenBook-Duo-14-UX481-Hackintosh">
      <img
        align="top"

      <strong>ASUS ZenBook Duo 14"</strong>
    </a>
  laptop built on top of the <strong>OpenCore</strong> bootloader. With it, I've
  created an ecosystem of tooling, docs, and extensions like
    <a href="https://github.com/Qonfused/OC-Build">
      <strong>‚öôÔ∏è OC-Build</strong>
    </a>
  and
    <a href="https://github.com/Qonfused/VoodooInjector">
      <strong>üíâ VoodooInjector</strong>
    </a>
  to help make Hackintosh projects easier and more reliable.

<p>
  My journey first began when I created the <strong>Videre Project</strong> back
  in 2018. It started as a pet project for <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong>
  exploring various <strong>data-science</strong> techniques and
  <strong>machine-learning</strong> architectures with
  <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Today, it's grown into dozens of projects like
  the
    <a href="https://github.com/videre-project/videre-tracker">
      <strong>üíæ Videre Tracker</strong>
    </a>
  and the
    <a href="https://github.com/videre-project/serverless-data-api">
      <strong>üì° Serverless Data API</strong>
    </a>
  that enable a <strong>real-time</strong> and
  <strong>highly distributed</strong> data platform. Together, they serve as a
  model for industry best-practices, integrating core principles of
  <strong>cooperative-interoperability</strong> and strong
  <strong>security-centric</strong> design.

  I'm always open to collaborate with others looking to expand and make the
  world of tech more accessible. If you'd like to involve me for a project,
